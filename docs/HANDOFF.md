# Handoff snapshot — 2026-09-11

**Why this file exists.** Working state for this repo normally lives in a per-machine
auto-memory directory (`~/.claude/projects/…/memory/`) that is **outside the repo and does not
travel**. This file is the in-repo subset a fresh checkout — a cloud session, another machine,
another person — actually needs. It is a dated snapshot, not a changelog: history is in
`git log`, rationale in `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs}/`, conventions in `CLAUDE.md`.

⚠ **Everything below was true at `6139386` unless a section says otherwise. Re-verify before
relying on it.**

## ✅ READ FIRST — master is FULL-SUITE GREEN at `f54416b` (2026-09-11)

`origin/master` == **`f54416b`**, which merged eight P2a-2 Task 14 commits (tip `87a6c5e`) into
master. **Full suite measured on Windows: 5826 tests, 4 failures — exactly the standing baseline
below, nothing new.**

Worth recording *because* it was in doubt: that merge combined two sides that had only ever been
gated apart. Task 14's commits are test-only (plus one small seam); the incoming master commits
changed `BasicLang/JavaScriptEmitter.cs`, `BasicLang/Program.cs` and
`BasicLang/ProjectSystem/TemplateEngine.cs`. They touch **no file in common**, and the full run
confirms the combination is clean.

⚠ **One thing is still unproven, and it is not about the build.** `46fd2c5` is a WIP commit whose
**27 tests pass but have no mutation kills and no review** — none has been shown to fail for the
right reason, or to fail at all. Green is not the same as proven, and these are exactly the kind
of assertion this task repeatedly found passing for structural reasons. It also carries the one
product change: `BasicLang/CSharpBackend.cs`, where the test seam `AmbientNamespacesForTest` (a
`static` alias that compared a constant with itself and could not fail even if the seeding loop
were deleted) becomes an instance view `CandidateUsingsForTest => _usings`. Emission was measured
unmoved (parity battery 22/0/0). **Proving those 27 tests is job #1 below.**

## Where things stand

Most recent work — a **JavaScript project type in the IDE**. The compiler could already emit a
web site, the build service could build one, and F5 could preview one, but the New Project
wizard had no way to *create* one. Shipped:

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| `SolutionTypes.JavaScript` (id `javascript`) and the `web-site` template | `VisualGameStudio.Core/Abstractions/Services/IProjectTemplateService.cs` |
| The `.blproj` writer and the page generator | `VisualGameStudio.ProjectSystem/Services/ProjectTemplateService.cs` |
| The wizard's "JavaScript (Web)" backend option | `VisualGameStudio.Shell/ViewModels/Dialogs/NewProjectWizardViewModel.cs` |
| CLI `basiclang new web` | `BasicLang/ProjectSystem/TemplateEngine.cs` |

Full detail, including the three defects found reviewing it, is in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-06-javascript-backend-interop-and-dom.md` under **Plan 2d**.

## Traps that cost real time here

These are measured, not cautionary. Each one shipped a green build that did the wrong thing.

- ⛔⛔ **A missing switch arm does not fail — it silently builds C#.** Four separate
  backend-dispatch maps have defaulted to C#. The most recent
  (`ProjectTemplateService.GenerateProjectFileContent`) would have written
  `<TargetBackend>CSharp</TargetBackend>` for a JavaScript project. Its default now throws, and
  `ProjectTemplateBackendMappingTests` pins every id in `SolutionTypes.All`. **When you add a
  backend or solution type, grep for every map keyed on it.**
- ⛔⛔ **The C# backend reconstructs control flow by matching block NAMES, not graph shape.**
  `IsIfThenElse` wants `.then`/`.else` and looks up `{prefix}.end`. A CFG named anything else
  falls to a path that emits both arms and **never the merge** — a program prints its first
  operand and stops. Name new CFGs exactly like `Visit(IfStatementNode)` does. The JS backend
  differs again (it derives the merge via `FindMergeBlock`, so the true target must never *be*
  the merge); C++ is goto-based and tolerates any shape.
- ⛔ **Every shipping route runs the IR optimizer; the unit-test helper does not.** A fixture
  can be green while the CLI and the IDE both miscompile. Validate codegen through the CLI or
  an optimizer-running helper. **stdout is the only valid oracle.**
- ⛔ **`IDE/` is a hand-committed xcopy drop and goes stale.** A stale drop has been mistaken
  for a code bug more than once. Deploy with `robocopy <Shell bin> IDE /E` — **never `/MIR`**,
  since the engine DLL and import lib live only there. **`IDE/lib/js/dom-core.bli` is
  load-bearing**: the deployed compiler auto-includes it for every JavaScript build, and
  without it the typed DOM does not resolve. Verify a refresh against the deployed files
  (`IDE/BasicLang.exe new --list`), never timestamps.
- ⛔ **A "Passed!" summary line does not mean the suite passed.** A crashed test host still
  prints a per-assembly summary; the abort goes to **stderr**. Capture both streams and check
  the total against the expected count, not just `Failed: 0`.
- ⛔ **Build contention looks exactly like a test failure.** A native test failing with
  `C++ compile timed out after 240s` is a load artifact. Measured: one such test "failed" after
  8m49s in a full run and passed alone in 34s. **Re-run in isolation before investigating; only
  an assertion failure is evidence.**
- ⛔ **Windows/PowerShell:** never round-trip repo files through `Get-Content`/`Set-Content`
  (it corrupts the BOM-less UTF-8 files here). Write commit messages to a file and use
  `git commit -F`. PowerShell 5.1 reports a native command's stderr as failure, so **verify a
  push by comparing SHAs, never by exit code**.

## Gates and expected numbers

```
dotnet test VisualGameStudio.Tests/VisualGameStudio.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet test VisualGameStudio.Tests/VisualGameStudio.Tests.csproj -c Release --filter "TestCategory!=Integration"
```

| Run | Count | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Full suite at **`f54416b`** (current master, Windows) | **5826 total, 4 failures — all baseline** | ~2h |
| Full suite at `6139386` | 5792 passed / 5 failed / 2 skipped of 5799 | ~2h |
| Fast subset at `6139386` | 4897 passed / 2 failed / 1 skipped | ~2 min |

The 5799 → 5826 move is P2a-2 Task 14's additions. The 5th failure in the `6139386` run was a
**contention timeout**, not a defect — `NothingInAHandleSlot_…_PinnedDivergence` "failed" after
8m49s in a loaded full run and passed alone in 34s.

**Four pre-existing failures are baseline and are not yours:** two `SearchSnippets_*`,
`Cli_Build_CppProject_ProjectReference_Warns…`, and `NonEx_variants…` (which passes alone and
fails only when the Native tier runs alongside it). The fast subset shows the two
`SearchSnippets` ones.

⛔ **The fast subset is not a gate for codegen work** — execution tests are
`[Category("Integration")]`. Four fixes once gated green on it, then the first full run found
17 failures and two real regressions already pushed.

## Open work

- **P2a-2 (.NET classes in native projects) — Task 14 is most of the way done; see below.**
  Task 15 is the closeout. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-02-p2a2-dotnet-native-flip.md`
  (Task 14 at :1834, Task 15 at :1862); spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-29-p2a-dotnet-access-aot-shim-design.md` (§12.4 at :1256,
  §12.5 at :1290).
- **VS Code extension host** — roughly 24 unimplemented requests, enumerated and enforced by
  `ExtensionHostRequestCoverageTests.KnownUnimplemented` (a second test fails once an entry is
  implemented, so the list must shrink). A missing `sendNotification` handler is a silent
  no-op; a missing `sendRequest` handler rejects inside `activate()` and kills the extension.
  Webviews still render as source text.
- **JavaScript backend** — the `lib.dom.d.ts` → `.bli` generator was never built
  (`dom-core.bli` is hand-curated). Known front-end gaps affecting all backends:
  `Inherits ArgumentException`, assigning an inherited field from a derived class,
  module-level non-constant initializers, C++ `raise_X()` taking no parameters, and
  `For Each … In items.Select(…)` inside a class method failing on C#.
- **The New Project wizard's JavaScript path has not been clicked through by a human.** Tests
  cover the view model and the template service; nothing here can drive the Avalonia window.
- Scope decisions already made — **MSIL and LLVM are out of scope** (do not test, fix, or file
  bugs on them), and **COM interop is ruled out**.

## P2a-2 Task 14 — what is done, and exactly what is left

**Done and gated at commit time** (eight commits, `8fae4f6`…`87a6c5e`):

- **Spec §12.5's five integration rows, complete.** A mixed BasicLang + hand-written C++ project
  where both sides call the same .NET library through the same generated proxies; a zero-`.bas`
  `<NetProxy>` project proving the startup TU is compiled, linked and initialised (with a
  shim-deleted negative asserting exit 3 and the load-failure line); the delegate round-trip;
  Console-only inertness at both emit and build level; and cold-then-warm caching hardened three
  ways, including the typed `CacheHit` outcome that was asserted nowhere.
- **§12.4's V1 and V4 invariants**: a golden cross-build mangle pin; slots ≡ exports over REAL
  collected surfaces and as the set identity `Exports = Slots ∪ CoreSeven`; the published shim's
  exports checked at EXECUTION level; the generated shim's scaffolding compared ON DISK; and
  `AbiVersion = 1` pinned directly (spec §13).

**Two findings worth keeping:**

- ⭐ **A shim missing one member export still BUILDS.** The C++ side links against the proxy
  *table*, not the shim's exports, so nothing at build time notices; the program passes the §9.3
  handshake and dies at its first .NET call. Only the new
  `EveryProxyTableSlotResolvesInThePublishedShim` (which `NativeLibrary.TryGetExport`s every slot
  against the deployed DLL) catches it. That is the runtime backstop chip `task_68a7198a` lacked.
- **`AddressOf` as a .NET delegate argument does not work**, though spec §8.4:694 promises it
  alongside lambdas. Measured through the shipping pipeline: `BL6017 … Argument 2 of
  'Aot.Probe.Callbacks.Fold' has no .NET type the analyzer can present for overload resolution
  (its static type is 'Func')`. The identical call with a lambda builds and runs. It is finished
  as a **pinned divergence** asserting that exact refusal, with a *replace, do not delete* note.

**Left to do, in order:**

1. **§12.4's V2 and V3 are UNPROVEN** — the WIP commit's 27 tests need their mutation kills, and
   **each must be DISCRIMINATING**: if a mutation also reds a pre-existing test it has proved
   nothing about the new one, so record the split ("1 red of 20"). The six: empty the `Rejected`
   registry set · make `MapTypeName`'s default arm skip the `NetRef` handle · remove one entry
   from `NetAmbientNamespaces.All` · delete the C# backend's seeding loop · flip one
   `CppCapabilityChecker.CheckType` early return · make `NetClaimPredicate` claim
   `File.ReadAllText`. Then review that commit properly.
3. **Task 15, the closeout.** Its inputs are already gathered: a detached worktree at
   `.worktrees/p2a1base` sits at `2752a96` for the empty-surface inertness diff (materialise the
   console and game templates, flip `<TargetBackend>` to Cpp, build at both commits, diff
   `obj/gen` + build log + stdout, subtract the two known splices `NetException` and `NetRef`).
   Spec status updates: header `Draft` → `Implemented`; §14.15 → Resolved; §15.11 → Decided;
   §15.6 → Recorded-unchanged. **Stale prose to sweep:** `NetInertnessTests`'s header still says
   `NetResolverFactory` is set "at exactly ONE site repo-wide" — false since Task 4
   (`EnableNetResolution` is also called at `BasicLang/Program.cs` :511 and :1076 and
   `BuildService.cs` :645; only the LSP leaves it null), plus dated "pre-flip" prose in
   `NetIrCarriageTests` and `NetFlipTests`.

**The failure mode this task kept finding — check for it in any test you write or review.**
Assertions that pass for structural reasons rather than because the property holds: a guard
asserting on text the test itself wrote; a comparison the product feeds both sides of (change one
*comment* in `BlnetShimSources.HandleTable` and the "verbatim" test stays green, because both its
sides move together); a hand-typed list standing in for a derived one; a guard against *empty*
that is not a guard against the *shape* that made the row worth having; a pin on a shape nothing
emits (the golden mangle literal once described an instance method as static); and a doc comment
describing a test that does not exist (`RowBAgreesWithTheCapabilityCheckersEarlyReturns` still
claims to drive the capability checker — the test project never constructs one).
