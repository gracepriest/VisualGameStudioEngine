# Handoff snapshot — 2026-09-11, updated 2026-09-13

**Why this file exists.** Working state for this repo normally lives in a per-machine
auto-memory directory (`~/.claude/projects/…/memory/`) that is **outside the repo and does not
travel**. This file is the in-repo subset a fresh checkout — a cloud session, another machine,
another person — actually needs. It is a dated snapshot, not a changelog: history is in
`git log`, rationale in `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs}/`, conventions in `CLAUDE.md`.

⚠ **Everything below was true at `6139386` unless a section says otherwise. Re-verify before
relying on it.** The 2026-09-13 section immediately below is newer than the rest of this file
and supersedes it wherever they disagree — in particular about whether a cloud container can
build and test this repo.

## ⛔ READ FIRST — 2026-09-13: a cloud container CAN build and test this repo

**This overturns the standing assumption that cloud sessions cannot gate.** A .NET 8 SDK installs
from the Ubuntu archive; the package index in a fresh container is just stale:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends dotnet-sdk-8.0   # ~1 min
```

`builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` IS blocked by the agent proxy, which is what made the earlier
"no compiler here" finding correct at the time and wrong now. Nothing else is needed: NuGet
restore works, the compiler and the test project both build, and the full suite runs.

**What that cost.** Twelve commits of form-designer work (`d8d6124`…`8c841f0`) were written,
reviewed by subagents, and reported as gated — with a compiler nobody had run. The first real
build found:

- **`VisualGameStudio.Tests` had not compiled since `0152506`** (CS0104: `MethodInfo` is
  ambiguous between `System.Reflection` and `VisualGameStudio.Core.Abstractions.Services`, which
  declares its own at `IRefactoringService.cs:131`). **Every "gate" reported in commits
  `0152506` through `8c841f0` was therefore never run.** Fixed in `e2c4c51`.
- Two tests that had never executed asserted the wrong thing — one demonstrated "an Int is bare"
  using a property the control's catalog row does not declare, the other counted `"Sub "`
  occurrences and expected the count to include `End Sub`, which has no trailing space.
- `CliTestHarness.CliPath()` hardcoded `BasicLang.exe`. The apphost is `BasicLang` with no
  extension off Windows, so **every spawned-CLI test in this suite was red on Linux**, and the
  failure read as "not deployed — project reference output changed?", which looks like a build
  layout problem rather than an unsupported platform. Fixing it turned 38 pre-existing failures
  green.

**Take the lesson, not just the fix:** subagent review is a decent proof-reader and is not a
compiler. It found 29 real defects across three passes and still missed a file that did not
compile.

### Measured on Linux, .NET 8.0.131 (this container)

| Run | Result | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Full suite, pre-branch baseline `6a6d224` | **174 failed / 5837 total** (5460 passed, 203 skipped) | ~8 min |
| Full suite, `feat/form-designer` tip | **174 failed / 6111 total** (5734 passed, 203 skipped) | ~7 min |
| Fast subset, baseline `6a6d224` | 90 failed / 4939 total | ~1 min |
| Fast subset, `feat/form-designer` tip | 90 failed / 5196 total | ~1 min |

⛔ **The two full-suite failure sets are IDENTICAL, compared by test name** — 174 names, no
regressions and no accidental fixes. That comparison, not the count, is the gate: run the
baseline in a `git worktree` and `comm -23` the sorted failure names. A raw count hides a
regression that lands as another test goes green.

⚠ **The 174 are environmental, not the Windows baseline of 4.** They are Windows-only tests on
Linux: 23 assert on hardcoded `C:\` paths, 10 need clang, 8 need MSVC/`vcvars`. **Do not treat
174 as "the number" on Windows** — re-measure there. The Windows baseline in the table further
down (5826 total / 4 failures at `f54416b`) is still the number that matters for a release.

⚠ The full suite takes **~7 minutes here, not ~2 hours**. That is not a faster machine: the
native/clang/MSVC integration tests fail fast instead of running. A green-looking short run on
Linux has not exercised codegen end-to-end.

### Form designer — where it actually is

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-11-visual-form-designer.md` (19 tasks).
Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-visual-form-designer-design.md`.
Branch: **`feat/form-designer`** (PR #4). Not merged.

**Done and now genuinely gated:** Tasks **1–6, 8–13, 15, 16**.

| Task | What landed |
|---|---|
| 1 | `ProjectSerializer` preserves the `.blproj` in place instead of rebuilding it from the model |
| 2–3 | TFM reaches the file; DPI mode emitted; two silent C# backend defaults now throw |
| 4 | Form model — geometry, controls, catalog, document, clipboard |
| 5 | The recognizer (importer) — WinForms and DOM dialects, values kept as raw source text |
| 6 | `DesignDiagnostic`, the `BL8xxx` band, `basiclang design --check` |
| 8 | `CSharpTestSupport` with the false-green guard |
| 9 | `.blwebform` reader/writer, D9 tiers, the algebra |
| 10 | Form documents ride as `<Compile>` and are skipped on both compile routes |
| 11 | Designer-owned marked regions — hashing, refusal, handler ordering |
| 12 | Markup/CSS/JS emission, the two-step `data-form` dispatch |
| 13 | Creating a form — the document + `.bas` pair, and the glob guard |
| **15** | **A missing handler is a hard error (D8)** |
| **16** | **`.blform` — the same reader and writer, not a second one** |

**Not done:** Task 7 and 14 (Avalonia canvas + property grid — they build here, but there is no
`Avalonia.Headless` package so nothing can drive them), 17–18 (WinForms catalog + region writing,
which need Windows to verify against the real toolchain), 19 (closeout).

### Contradictions found against the spec and the briefing

1. **The briefing's platform table is wrong** — see the top of this section. Tasks marked
   "build but unverifiable" and "needs the full suite" were both doable here.
2. **`FormClipboard` used `(int?)` casts on XML attributes**, which throw `FormatException` on a
   non-integer. The clipboard is precisely where unvetted text arrives; a paste carrying
   `X="20px"` took the IDE down rather than declining the paste. Now `int.TryParse`, like every
   other reader in the feature.
3. **"Structural attribute" is not a property of the attribute NAME.** The two formats overlap in
   spelling and not in meaning — `Width` is a `.blform` control's pixel width and is read into its
   geometry, while on a `.blwebform` control nothing reads it. Under one flat list it was neither
   a property nor an unknown attribute: absent from the model entirely, and dropped by anything
   rebuilding the document from it. `IsStructural` now takes a `FormTarget`.
4. **The spec does not say what happens when a file's NAME disagrees with its ROOT element.** A
   `.blform` containing `<WebForm>` is now REFUSED. Neither side can be believed over the other:
   trust the root and the writer emits one format's geometry into a file the project system
   compiles as the other; trust the extension and every `X`/`Y` reads as an unknown attribute and
   the canvas comes up empty. Both are invisible until the user saves.
5. **Task 15 could not be implemented as the plan words it.** The plan says to error whenever
   `GetNodeSymbol(operand)` is null. That would reject every correct WinForms program, this
   designer's generated output included, because `EnableNetResolution` returns early for
   `UseWindowsForms` (`Compiler.cs:145`) and the resolver closure cannot reach
   `System.Windows.Forms.dll` — so every `AddressOf Me.Handler` has a null symbol and always
   will. **Implemented narrower:** the only new error is a BARE NAME that resolved to no symbol
   at all. A member access is left alone. `IsNetType` is NOT narrowed, per the plan's own warning.
   The `AddHandler`/`RemoveHandler` validation is likewise silent whenever the event side is
   unresolved, and reports only a resolved symbol that is plainly not an event, a parameter-count
   disagreement, or two *primitive* parameter types that differ. There is no assignability helper
   in `SemanticAnalyzer` to widen that last one with, and comparing class names would flag
   `EventArgs` against `MouseEventArgs` — the ordinary correct shape of a handler.

### What the next session should pick up

1. **Re-run the full suite on Windows.** Everything above is a Linux measurement. The Windows
   number to beat is 5826 total / 4 failures at `f54416b`; this branch adds 274 tests.
2. **Tasks 17–18** (WinForms catalog + region writing). Task 16 exists to give 18 an input
   document; it now has one. ⛔ The catalog is **unfalsifiable** without the real toolchain —
   every `Form`/`Button` member types as `Object` with no diagnostic, so a misspelled property
   name compiles green. The gate has to be a sweep that generates every control with every
   property and requires the real CLI to exit 0, driven from `FormControlCatalog.All`.
3. **Tasks 7 and 14** (canvas + property grid) — need a machine that can run Avalonia.
4. **Task 19**, closeout.
5. **PR #3 (`claude/busy-newton-gsispd`)** is still open carrying a superseded spec/plan pair.
   It should be closed or stripped to just the SessionStart hook.

## ✅ 2026-09-11 — master is FULL-SUITE GREEN at `f54416b`

*(Still true, and still the Windows number that matters. Read the 2026-09-13 section above
first: it is newer, and it contradicts this file's assumption about cloud sessions.)*

`origin/master` == **`f54416b`**, which merged eight P2a-2 Task 14 commits (tip `87a6c5e`) into
master. **Full suite measured on Windows: 5826 tests, 4 failures — exactly the standing baseline
below, nothing new.**

Worth recording *because* it was in doubt: that merge combined two sides that had only ever been
gated apart. Task 14's commits are test-only (plus one small seam); the incoming master commits
changed `BasicLang/JavaScriptEmitter.cs`, `BasicLang/Program.cs` and
`BasicLang/ProjectSystem/TemplateEngine.cs`. They touch **no file in common**, and the full run
confirms the combination is clean.

⚠ **One thing is still unproven, and it is not about the build.** `46fd2c5` is a WIP commit whose
**27 tests pass but have no mutation kills and no review** — none has been shown to fail for the
right reason, or to fail at all. Green is not the same as proven, and these are exactly the kind
of assertion this task repeatedly found passing for structural reasons. It also carries the one
product change: `BasicLang/CSharpBackend.cs`, where the test seam `AmbientNamespacesForTest` (a
`static` alias that compared a constant with itself and could not fail even if the seeding loop
were deleted) becomes an instance view `CandidateUsingsForTest => _usings`. Emission was measured
unmoved (parity battery 22/0/0). **Proving those 27 tests is job #1 below.**

---

## Where things stand

Most recent work — a **JavaScript project type in the IDE**. The compiler could already emit a
web site, the build service could build one, and F5 could preview one, but the New Project
wizard had no way to *create* one. Shipped:

| Piece | Where |
|---|---|
| `SolutionTypes.JavaScript` (id `javascript`) and the `web-site` template | `VisualGameStudio.Core/Abstractions/Services/IProjectTemplateService.cs` |
| The `.blproj` writer and the page generator | `VisualGameStudio.ProjectSystem/Services/ProjectTemplateService.cs` |
| The wizard's "JavaScript (Web)" backend option | `VisualGameStudio.Shell/ViewModels/Dialogs/NewProjectWizardViewModel.cs` |
| CLI `basiclang new web` | `BasicLang/ProjectSystem/TemplateEngine.cs` |

Full detail, including the three defects found reviewing it, is in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-06-javascript-backend-interop-and-dom.md` under **Plan 2d**.

---

## Traps that cost real time here

These are measured, not cautionary. Each one shipped a green build that did the wrong thing.

- ⛔⛔ **A missing switch arm does not fail — it silently builds C#.** Four separate
  backend-dispatch maps have defaulted to C#. The most recent
  (`ProjectTemplateService.GenerateProjectFileContent`) would have written
  `<TargetBackend>CSharp</TargetBackend>` for a JavaScript project. Its default now throws, and
  `ProjectTemplateBackendMappingTests` pins every id in `SolutionTypes.All`. **When you add a
  backend or solution type, grep for every map keyed on it.**
- ⛔⛔ **The C# backend reconstructs control flow by matching block NAMES, not graph shape.**
  `IsIfThenElse` wants `.then`/`.else` and looks up `{prefix}.end`. A CFG named anything else
  falls to a path that emits both arms and **never the merge** — a program prints its first
  operand and stops. Name new CFGs exactly like `Visit(IfStatementNode)` does. The JS backend
  differs again (it derives the merge via `FindMergeBlock`, so the true target must never *be*
  the merge); C++ is goto-based and tolerates any shape.
- ⛔ **Every shipping route runs the IR optimizer; the unit-test helper does not.** A fixture
  can be green while the CLI and the IDE both miscompile. Validate codegen through the CLI or
  an optimizer-running helper. **stdout is the only valid oracle.**
- ⛔ **`IDE/` is a hand-committed xcopy drop and goes stale.** A stale drop has been mistaken
  for a code bug more than once. Deploy with `robocopy <Shell bin> IDE /E` — **never `/MIR`**,
  since the engine DLL and import lib live only there. **`IDE/lib/js/dom-core.bli` is
  load-bearing**: the deployed compiler auto-includes it for every JavaScript build, and
  without it the typed DOM does not resolve. Verify a refresh against the deployed files
  (`IDE/BasicLang.exe new --list`), never timestamps.
- ⛔ **A "Passed!" summary line does not mean the suite passed.** A crashed test host still
  prints a per-assembly summary; the abort goes to **stderr**. Capture both streams and check
  the total against the expected count, not just `Failed: 0`.
- ⛔ **Build contention looks exactly like a test failure.** A native test failing with
  `C++ compile timed out after 240s` is a load artifact. Measured: one such test "failed" after
  8m49s in a full run and passed alone in 34s. **Re-run in isolation before investigating; only
  an assertion failure is evidence.**
- ⛔ **Windows/PowerShell:** never round-trip repo files through `Get-Content`/`Set-Content`
  (it corrupts the BOM-less UTF-8 files here). Write commit messages to a file and use
  `git commit -F`. PowerShell 5.1 reports a native command's stderr as failure, so **verify a
  push by comparing SHAs, never by exit code**.

## Gates and expected numbers

```
dotnet test VisualGameStudio.Tests/VisualGameStudio.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet test VisualGameStudio.Tests/VisualGameStudio.Tests.csproj -c Release --filter "TestCategory!=Integration"
```

⚠ These are **Windows** numbers. For Linux/cloud numbers — and for the worktree-diff method that
should be used instead of comparing raw counts — see the 2026-09-13 section at the top.

| Run | Count | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Full suite at **`f54416b`** (current master, Windows) | **5826 total, 4 failures — all baseline** | ~2h |
| Full suite at `6139386` | 5792 passed / 5 failed / 2 skipped of 5799 | ~2h |
| Fast subset at `6139386` | 4897 passed / 2 failed / 1 skipped | ~2 min |

The 5799 → 5826 move is P2a-2 Task 14's additions. The 5th failure in the `6139386` run was a
**contention timeout**, not a defect — `NothingInAHandleSlot_…_PinnedDivergence` "failed" after
8m49s in a loaded full run and passed alone in 34s.

**Four pre-existing failures are baseline and are not yours:** two `SearchSnippets_*`,
`Cli_Build_CppProject_ProjectReference_Warns…`, and `NonEx_variants…` (which passes alone and
fails only when the Native tier runs alongside it). The fast subset shows the two
`SearchSnippets` ones.

⛔ **The fast subset is not a gate for codegen work** — execution tests are
`[Category("Integration")]`. Four fixes once gated green on it, then the first full run found
17 failures and two real regressions already pushed.

---

## Open work

- **P2a-2 (.NET classes in native projects) — Task 14 is most of the way done; see below.**
  Task 15 is the closeout. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-02-p2a2-dotnet-native-flip.md`
  (Task 14 at :1834, Task 15 at :1862); spec:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-29-p2a-dotnet-access-aot-shim-design.md` (§12.4 at :1256,
  §12.5 at :1290).
- **VS Code extension host** — roughly 24 unimplemented requests, enumerated and enforced by
  `ExtensionHostRequestCoverageTests.KnownUnimplemented` (a second test fails once an entry is
  implemented, so the list must shrink). A missing `sendNotification` handler is a silent
  no-op; a missing `sendRequest` handler rejects inside `activate()` and kills the extension.
  Webviews still render as source text.
- **JavaScript backend** — the `lib.dom.d.ts` → `.bli` generator was never built
  (`dom-core.bli` is hand-curated). Known front-end gaps affecting all backends:
  `Inherits ArgumentException`, assigning an inherited field from a derived class,
  module-level non-constant initializers, C++ `raise_X()` taking no parameters, and
  `For Each … In items.Select(…)` inside a class method failing on C#.
- **The New Project wizard's JavaScript path has not been clicked through by a human.** Tests
  cover the view model and the template service; nothing here can drive the Avalonia window.
- Scope decisions already made — **MSIL and LLVM are out of scope** (do not test, fix, or file
  bugs on them), and **COM interop is ruled out**.

---

## P2a-2 Task 14 — what is done, and exactly what is left

**Done and gated at commit time** (eight commits, `8fae4f6`…`87a6c5e`):

- **Spec §12.5's five integration rows, complete.** A mixed BasicLang + hand-written C++ project
  where both sides call the same .NET library through the same generated proxies; a zero-`.bas`
  `<NetProxy>` project proving the startup TU is compiled, linked and initialised (with a
  shim-deleted negative asserting exit 3 and the load-failure line); the delegate round-trip;
  Console-only inertness at both emit and build level; and cold-then-warm caching hardened three
  ways, including the typed `CacheHit` outcome that was asserted nowhere.
- **§12.4's V1 and V4 invariants**: a golden cross-build mangle pin; slots ≡ exports over REAL
  collected surfaces and as the set identity `Exports = Slots ∪ CoreSeven`; the published shim's
  exports checked at EXECUTION level; the generated shim's scaffolding compared ON DISK; and
  `AbiVersion = 1` pinned directly (spec §13).

**Two findings worth keeping:**

- ⭐ **A shim missing one member export still BUILDS.** The C++ side links against the proxy
  *table*, not the shim's exports, so nothing at build time notices; the program passes the §9.3
  handshake and dies at its first .NET call. Only the new
  `EveryProxyTableSlotResolvesInThePublishedShim` (which `NativeLibrary.TryGetExport`s every slot
  against the deployed DLL) catches it. That is the runtime backstop chip `task_68a7198a` lacked.
- **`AddressOf` as a .NET delegate argument does not work**, though spec §8.4:694 promises it
  alongside lambdas. Measured through the shipping pipeline: `BL6017 … Argument 2 of
  'Aot.Probe.Callbacks.Fold' has no .NET type the analyzer can present for overload resolution
  (its static type is 'Func')`. The identical call with a lambda builds and runs. It is finished
  as a **pinned divergence** asserting that exact refusal, with a *replace, do not delete* note.

**Left to do, in order:**

1. **§12.4's V2 and V3 are UNPROVEN** — the WIP commit's 27 tests need their mutation kills, and
   **each must be DISCRIMINATING**: if a mutation also reds a pre-existing test it has proved
   nothing about the new one, so record the split ("1 red of 20"). The six: empty the `Rejected`
   registry set · make `MapTypeName`'s default arm skip the `NetRef` handle · remove one entry
   from `NetAmbientNamespaces.All` · delete the C# backend's seeding loop · flip one
   `CppCapabilityChecker.CheckType` early return · make `NetClaimPredicate` claim
   `File.ReadAllText`. Then review that commit properly.
3. **Task 15, the closeout.** Its inputs are already gathered: a detached worktree at
   `.worktrees/p2a1base` sits at `2752a96` for the empty-surface inertness diff (materialise the
   console and game templates, flip `<TargetBackend>` to Cpp, build at both commits, diff
   `obj/gen` + build log + stdout, subtract the two known splices `NetException` and `NetRef`).
   Spec status updates: header `Draft` → `Implemented`; §14.15 → Resolved; §15.11 → Decided;
   §15.6 → Recorded-unchanged. **Stale prose to sweep:** `NetInertnessTests`'s header still says
   `NetResolverFactory` is set "at exactly ONE site repo-wide" — false since Task 4
   (`EnableNetResolution` is also called at `BasicLang/Program.cs` :511 and :1076 and
   `BuildService.cs` :645; only the LSP leaves it null), plus dated "pre-flip" prose in
   `NetIrCarriageTests` and `NetFlipTests`.

**The failure mode this task kept finding — check for it in any test you write or review.**
Assertions that pass for structural reasons rather than because the property holds: a guard
asserting on text the test itself wrote; a comparison the product feeds both sides of (change one
*comment* in `BlnetShimSources.HandleTable` and the "verbatim" test stays green, because both its
sides move together); a hand-typed list standing in for a derived one; a guard against *empty*
that is not a guard against the *shape* that made the row worth having; a pin on a shape nothing
emits (the golden mangle literal once described an instance method as static); and a doc comment
describing a test that does not exist (`RowBAgreesWithTheCapabilityCheckersEarlyReturns` still
claims to drive the capability checker — the test project never constructs one).
