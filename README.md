# VisualGameStudioEngine


<p>Visual Game Studio is a modern game development environment designed to make creating 2D and 3D games fast, flexible, and fun. At its core is Visual Game Basic, a lightweight yet powerful framework built on top of the proven RayLib library.

Unlike traditional engines, Visual Game Basic lives inside a DLL, giving developers a single, efficient framework that can be called from multiple languages—including Visual Basic, C++, and C#. This cross-language design means you can build games in the language you love without sacrificing performance or reinventing the wheel.
